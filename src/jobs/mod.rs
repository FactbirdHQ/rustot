//! # Iot Jobs Data
//!
//! ## Programming Devices to Work with Jobs
//!
//! The examples in this section use MQTT to illustrate how a device works with
//! the AWS IoT Jobs service. Alternatively, you could use the corresponding API
//! or CLI commands. For these examples, we assume a device called MyThing
//! subscribes to the following MQTT topics:
//!
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/notify (or
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/notify-next)
//!
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/get/accepted
//!
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/get/rejected
//!
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/{jobId}/get/accepted
//!
//! $aws/things/{MyThing}/jobs/{jobId}/get/rejected
//!
//! If you are using Code-signing for AWS IoT your device code must verify the
//! signature of your code file. The signature is in the job document in the
//! codesign property.
//!
//! ## Workflow:
//! 1. When a device first comes online, it should subscribe to the device's
//!    notify-next topic.
//! 2. Call the DescribeJobExecution MQTT API with jobId $next to get the next
//!    job, its job document, and other details, including any state saved in
//!    statusDetails. If the job document has a code file signature, you must
//!    verify the signature before proceeding with processing the job request.
//! 3. Call the UpdateJobExecution MQTT API to update the job status. Or, to
//!    combine this and the previous step in one call, the device can call
//!    StartNextPendingJobExecution.
//! 4. (Optional) You can add a step timer by setting a value for
//!    stepTimeoutInMinutes when you call either UpdateJobExecution or
//!    StartNextPendingJobExecution.
//! 5. Perform the actions specified by the job document using the
//!    UpdateJobExecution MQTT API to report on the progress of the job.
//! 6. Continue to monitor the job execution by calling the DescribeJobExecution
//!    MQTT API with this jobId. If the job execution is canceled or deleted
//!    while the device is running the job, the device should be capable of
//!    recovering to a valid state.
//! 7. Call the UpdateJobExecution MQTT API when finished with the job to update
//!    the job status and report success or failure.
//! 8. Because this job's execution status has been changed to a terminal state,
//!    the next job available for execution (if any) changes. The device is
//!    notified that the next pending job execution has changed. At this point,
//!    the device should continue as described in step 2.
//!
//! If the device remains online, it continues to receive a notifications of the
//! next pending job execution, including its job execution data, when it
//! completes a job or a new pending job execution is added. When this occurs,
//! the device continues as described in step 2.
//!
//! If the device is unable to execute the job, it should call the
//! UpdateJobExecution MQTT API to update the job status to REJECTED.
//!
//!
//! ## Jobs Notifications
//! The AWS IoT Jobs service publishes MQTT messages to reserved topics when
//! jobs are pending or when the first job execution in the list changes.
//! Devices can keep track of pending jobs by subscribing to these topics.
//!
//! Job notifications are published to MQTT topics as JSON payloads. There are
//! two kinds of notifications:
//!
//! A ListNotification contains a list of no more than 10 pending job
//! executions. The job executions in this list have status values of either
//! IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED. They are sorted by status (IN_PROGRESS job executions
//! before QUEUED job executions) and then by the times when they were queued.
//!
//! A ListNotification is published whenever one of the following criteria is
//! met.
//!
//! A new job execution is queued or changes to a non-terminal status
//! (IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED).
//!
//! An old job execution changes to a terminal status (FAILED, SUCCEEDED,
//! CANCELED, TIMED_OUT, REJECTED, or REMOVED).
//!
//! A NextNotification contains summary information about the one job execution
//! that is next in the queue.
//!
//! A NextNotification is published whenever the first job execution in the list
//! changes.
//!
//! A new job execution is added to the list as QUEUED, and it is the first one
//! in the list.
//!
//! The status of an existing job execution that was not the first one in the
//! list changes from QUEUED to IN_PROGRESS and becomes the first one in the
//! list. (This happens when there are no other IN_PROGRESS job executions in
//! the list or when the job execution whose status changes from QUEUED to
//! IN_PROGRESS was queued earlier than any other IN_PROGRESS job execution in
//! the list.)
//!
//! The status of the job execution that is first in the list changes to a
//! terminal status and is removed from the list.
